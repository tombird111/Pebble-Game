Pebble is its own separate class, as we can use them all separately outside of a bag.
PebbleBag colour is only a string, as withdrawing and depositing to a bag is used for both.
We create a list of integers in Pebbles, as that lets us handle the instancing of pebbles within a pebbleBag.
The specification says that multiple players should play, so you need more than one player.

IF WE MAKE A GAMEWON VARIABLE THAT IS AN ATOMICBOOLEAN,
THEN WE ONLY NEED TO CONTINUE RUNNING THREADS UNTIL GAMEWON IS DONE! (VOLATILE MAY ALSO BE GOOD)

I THINK MAKE PLAYERS A NESTED CLASS IN THE CLASS (cause players won't exist outside of the game)
